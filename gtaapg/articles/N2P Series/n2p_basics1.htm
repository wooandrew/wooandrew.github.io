                    <h4 class="article sub title">Classes</h4>
                    <p>Classes define the role you will be playing in AAPG. There are four different classes in AAPG:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rifleman</li>
                        <li>Automatic Rifleman</li>
                        <li>Designated Marksman</li>
                        <li>Sniper</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each class has their own functions and are equally important. However, having too many of one but not the other will lead to disastrous results. By default, the class are split like so:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>∞ Rifleman</li>
                        <li>2 Automatic Rifleman</li>
                        <li>2 Designated Marksman</li>
                        <li>1 Sniper</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    However, these may change depending on the server and map you play on. Each class serves their own purpose, and each class has different playstyles. Typically, the Riflemen and Auto-riflemen are front-line fighters. The Riflemen provide the accuracy in close to medium range, while the auto-riflemen suppress fire. Meanwhile, Designated Marksmen and Snipers cover the front-line fighters from a distance. Usually, the sniper stays behind, shooting from long range, while designated-marksmen will mainly shoot from medium to long range distances. How each class is played changes with the map design, and I will cover them in future articles.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="article sub title">Weapons</h4>
                    <p>There are many different weapons for you to choose from. From short-range shotguns to longer range sniper rifles, each gun is suited for a different task, and each will allow you to customize your play style. Each class has different weapons, and here they are listed:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rifleman
                            <ul>
                                <li>M1A1 Carbine</li>
                                <li>M16A4 Rifle</li>
                                <li>Remington 870 MCS</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Automatic Rifleman
                            <ul>
                                <li>M249 SAW</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Designated Marksman
                            <ul>
                                <li>M16A4 Rifle</li>
                                <li>M14EBR-RI Rifle</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Sniper
                            <ul>
                                <li>M14EBR-RI Rifle</li>
                                <li>M24 Sniper Rifle</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each weapon is fitted for each class, even the ones that are shared between classes. However, while all of the weapons are powerful when used properly, each weapon is suited for different situations, and each should be used strategically. Also, while both the Designated Marksman and Sniper classes have 2 weapons, you should try to use the M14EBR-RI Rifle and M24 Sniper Rifle, respectively. This is because of the damage they deal, which we will talk about later. We will cover these weapons more in depth later.

                    <br>
                    <h4 class="article sub title">Settings and Keybinds</h4>
                    <p>Now, the most important part about AAPG, and the thing that will increase your skill tenfold, is key-binds. I cannot stress the importance of key-binds: they will drastically change your gaming experience. Each and every bind should be mapped for maximum efficiency; to allow you make game-changing moves. For example, my key-binds look like this:</p>
                    <img id="keybinds" alt="FlamingThanatos' Keybinds" src="img/keyboard-layout2.png">
                    <p>As you can see, all of my more important key-binds are mapped very close together. This is to maximize efficiency; so I can shoot with my right hand and do everything else with my left, all while focusing completely on the game. Because my keys are so closely mapped together, I can use a variety of combinations to make my chances of surviving better. Furthermore, less important binds are placed farther away. Keys for Inspecting weapons, dropping objectives, interacting, and global voice chat are all far away for one reason: because they should not be done unless the immediate area is completely safe and secured. That way, when performing these actions, you have a very miniscule chance of having to quickly switch to other keys to defend yourself. I won't get too in-detail with other settings, but depending on how much RAM you have, you should set video settings to low, medium, or high. (4RAM = Low, 8RAM = Medium or High, 8+RAM = High)</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="article sub title">Game Modes</h4>
                    <p>There are two different types of missions: FLO, and BDX. FLO stands for Forward Line Operations, and take place in larger maps using a 12v12 roster. BDX stands for Battle Drill Exercise, and uses a 6v6 fire squad format.</p>
                    <p>There are 5 different gamemodes in AAPG: Extract, Activate, Take and Hold, C4, and VIP:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Extract [EX]
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Assault team must locate and secure the objective, represented by the 2/56 LRCAR Guidon Flag.</li>
                                <li>After securing the objective, the Assault team must carry the flag to the marked extract location.</li>
                                <li>If the flag carrier is neutralized, the flag is dropped where it will remain until either it is picked up again or the round ends.</li>
                                <li>The Defense team cannot interact with the Guidon Flag. Their only mission is to neutralize the entire Assault team before they can movethe flag to the extraction zone.</li>
                                <li>If the entire Defense team is neutralized, Assault wins the round. If time expires before the flag reached the extraction zone, Defense wins.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Activate [AC]
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Assault team is tasked with locating up to 3 devices placed around the level.</li>
                                <li>Activating the devices requires 8 seconds of uninterrupted interaction.</li>
                                <li>Defense cannot interact with the objectives. Their only mission is to neutralize the entire Assault team before they can activate all of the devices.</li>
                                <li>If the entire Defense team is neutralized, Assault wins the round. If time expires before Assault activates all of the devices, Defense wins.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>VIP [VIP]
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Escort team must escort the VIP to the extract point</li>
                                <li>Defense is tasked with taking down and securing the VIP.</li>
                                <li>If the VIP escapes or the Defense team is neutralized, the game ends and Escort team wins.</li>
                                <li>If the entire Escort team is neutralized or the VIP is secured, Defense wins the round. If the timer expires, Defense scores the win.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Take and Hold [TH]
                            <ul>
                                <li>At the start of each round, all objectives are flagged as neutral.</li>
                                <li>Activate each objective to secure it.</li>
                                <li>Once you’ve secured an objective you must defend it because the opposing team can take it from you.</li>
                                <li>To win, a team must have all the objectives secured at the same time</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>C4 [C4]
                            <ul>
                                <li>To win, the assault team must place an explosive device at one of two objective locations.</li>
                                <li>The defenders must prevent this by either disarming a placed explosive charge, or eliminating the entire assault force.</li>
                                <li>The defenders may also win by securing the explosive if it has been dropped.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each game mode requires precise and careful planning and communication. It will require you to be able to adapt to new situations, react quickly, and overall be strategetic.</p>
                    <p>That's it for this article! Look out for part 2, where I'll be talking more about weapons and game mechanics.</p>
