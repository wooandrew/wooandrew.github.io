                    <p>Welcome to FlamingThanatos Productions!<br>This website is my personal website, created for no reason really. It has links to some of my projects, both programming and otherwise. <br><br>What I Use:<br></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Laptop | HP-15-ay039wm</li>
                        <p class="explain">Self explanatory. This is what I use on a daily basis for pretty much everything.</p>
                        <li>Code::Blocks</li>
                        <p class="explain">Code::Blocks is a minimalistic C++ IDE. It has less features than Visual Studio, but is also less convoluted, which is why it is my preferred C++ IDE.<br> http://www.codeblocks.org/</p>
                        <li>PyCharm</li>
                        <p class="explain">PyCharm is one of the best, if not THE best, Python IDE. With a simplistic and friendly UI, it is definitely one of my favourites of all time.<br> https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/</p>
                        <li>Adobe Brackets</li>
                        <p class="explain">While not my first choice, the fact that Adobe Brackets is one of the only HTML/CSS Editors with live offline development makes it my preferred tool for web development. <br>http://brackets.io/</p>
                        <li>Firefox Developer Edition</li>
                        <p class="explain">The absolute best browser ever. Built specifically for web designers and first of its kind, Firefox Developer Edition in conjunction with Adobe Brackets is irreplaceable.<br>https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/</p>
                        <li>Eclipse Oxygen</li>
                        <p class="explain">I hate Java. Nonetheless, I feel it is important to understand the concepts of such a popular language, so whenever I code with Java, I use Eclipse Oxygen.<br>https://www.eclipse.org/</p>
                        <li>RAPTOR by USAF</li>
                        <p class="explain">RAPTOR holds a special place in my heart: It taught me how to code. Developed by the U.S Airforce, RAPTOR helps people visualize code.<br>http://raptor.martincarlisle.com/</p>
                        <li>MIT Scratch</li>
                        <p class="explain">I don't do much with MIT Scratch. But it's pretty cool, and I use it to teach programming.<br>https://scratch.mit.edu/</p>
                        <li>Blender on Steam</li>
                        <p class="explain">Blender is a 3D Modeling program. I use the Steam version for the automatic updates. The logo for Encrypter was designed using Blender.<br>https://www.blender.org/</p>
                        <li>Inkscape</li>
                        <p class="explain last">Inskape is a great free replacement for Photoshop. It has similar features, and is simple to use. The logo for Directory.h was designed using it.<br>https://inkscape.org/en/</p>
