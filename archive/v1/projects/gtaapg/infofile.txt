This project is property of Andrew Woo and Abby Mills, 2017
The creation of this basic website was suggested by Abby Mills.
The website was coded by Andrew Woo.

Information:

Guide to AAPG [America's Army: Proving Grounds] is a challenge inspired by
Abby Mills to create a website with a sort of guide to becoming better at AAPG.

This website contains material that is strictly compromised of my personal
experience in AAPG. Statistics, however, maybe taken from a wiki site or the
official AAPG website [americasarmy.com].
